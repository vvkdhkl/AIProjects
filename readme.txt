These are standalone projects as part of my coursework on AI and searches.
PlanningProblem.py implements search algorithms (like A*) to move an agent from origin to the goal.

ReinforcementLearning.py is used to implement rewards based movement of agent across the grid to learn 
the rewards iteratively and hence reach the goal.
